# Search-projects-on-Scratch-Profile
Adds a Searchbar for projects to the Scratch profile page. It links to my [User Project Search](https://steve0greatness.github.io/extras/User-Project-Search.html).

## installation
First and foremost, you need to install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) for this to work.

You can use this by [Downloading the File](https://github.com/Steve0Greatness/Search-projects-on-Scratch-Profile/blob/main/README.md) or by using the download by url feature([put in this url](https://github.com/Steve0Greatness/Search-projects-on-Scratch-Profile/raw/main/Search%20projects%20on%20Scratch%20Profile.user.js)).
