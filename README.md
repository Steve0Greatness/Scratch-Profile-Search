# Scratch Profile Search
This userscript for [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) adds a search bar to all profile pages(`/[user]/projects`) that lets you search all the projects

## Installation
First and foremost, you need to install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) for this to work. When you have Tampermonkey installed, simply go to [this link](https://github.com/Steve0Greatness/Scratch-Profile-Search/raw/main/Scratch-Profile-Search.user.js)

## Settings
As of currently, settings must be changed by going into the code. It's in an object named "settings".
